OX - test number
0) The algorithm used for this task is caching some information for better performance. This test shows the speed of pre-calculating/caching
1) Very small, tiny test
2) Medium size test
3) A huge test of small identical prime cached numbers and one not prime
4) A huge test of big identical prime not cached numbers
4) Small anti-quicksort like test
5) Another medium size test, but a bit bigger
6) Many values close to max int
7) [5] (Basically, just one five)
